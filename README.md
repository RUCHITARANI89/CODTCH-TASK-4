Task: Setting Up Monitoring for a Cloud-Based Application Using AWS CloudWatch

This project involves configuring AWS CloudWatch to monitor a cloud-based application, ensuring performance tracking, log analysis, and proactive alerts. The setup helps maintain system health, optimize performance, and troubleshoot issues efficiently.

### **Task Highlights**

1. **CloudWatch Setup**
   - Created CloudWatch Dashboards to visualize application metrics in a centralized view.
   - Configured Alarms to notify when specific thresholds are exceeded.
     
2. **Log Monitoring**:
   -  Enabled CloudWatch Logs to capture application logs for debugging and analysis.
   -  Set Up Log Retention Policies to manage log storage and reduce costs.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Integrated EC2, RDS, and S3 Metrics to monitor CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, and network traffic.
   - Analyzed Application Latency to detect performance bottlenecks.
     
4. **Automated Alerts & Notifications**:
   - Configured SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send alerts via email/SMS.
   - Set Up Alarms for CPU utilization, disk space, and network latency spikes.
     
5. **Cost Optimization & Insights**:
   - Utilized CloudWatch Metrics to analyze resource usage and optimize cloud costs.
   - Created Reports on performance trends to improve efficiency.
     
   
### **Key Achievements**
